## Abstract

This section presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting systematic bibliometric analysis of academic literature using advanced computational techniques. The developed framework integrates multiple analytical approaches including network analysis, temporal trend analysis, citation impact assessment, and machine learning-based topic modeling to provide robust insights into research domains.

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 1.1 Literature Search Strategy

Our systematic literature collection employed the SerpApi interface to Google Scholar, implementing the following protocols:

- **Search Algorithm**: Utilized keyword-based retrieval with standardized Boolean operators
- **Temporal Scope**: Publications spanning 1990-2025 to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Result Limitation**: Maximum 3,000 publications per query to balance comprehensiveness with computational efficiency
- **Quality Threshold**: Minimum title length of 10 characters to filter out incomplete records

### 1.2 Data Validation and Cleaning

A rigorous data preprocessing pipeline was implemented:

```python
# Data Quality Metrics Applied:
